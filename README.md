# hello-world
My first ever repository!

I'm David, a wannabe web-developer that comes from Croatia. I love listening to music, keeping up the vibes, writing, photography and programming. Creative stuff fascinates me because I can leave a mark on the world and be remembered for that. Also, travelling is my new passion as I have been inspired by so many stories and people who travel mindfully.
